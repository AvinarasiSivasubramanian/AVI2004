'''Write a program that generates a set of squares of numbers in the range(1-30) and another list generates numbers that are divisible by 3 in the range(1-30). Generate a newset from a square set, which should not contain the numbers that are divisible by 3.'''

square_set = {num**2 for num in range(1, 31)}


divisible_by_3_list = [num for num in range(1, 31) if num % 3 == 0]


new_set = square_set - set(divisible_by_3_list)
